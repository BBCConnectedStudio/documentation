Unfinished (unfit) pages - address these first!
===============================================

### overview/deployment.md
- detail handover plan, scripts/instructions etc. Set expectations & requirements
- details for troubleshooting? where are logs etc?
- we can do DNS record for Third Party hosted?

### overview/information-security.md
- detail why
- detail each component function inputs/outputs
- overview of forms to fill in
- overview of process (fill in forms, submit for review, answer raised concerns)

### overview/publishing.md
- some explanation of how a pilot is turned on in Taster
- add note about previewing in Taster (?preview=true)



Documents that need more adding to them
=======================================

### overview/analytics-documentation.md
- separate 'why analytics' and implementation details into distinct documents
- link implementation detail (how to add Echo) doc from RH column on main README.md

### overview/pilot-kickoff-pack.md
- Link from intro section of README.md?
- Can it be made smaller, does it duplicate info in other pages?

### overview/supported-devices.md
- add info about 'in pilot browser detection'

### technical/AWS-info.md
- advice for scaling
- explicit we use it, constraints on pilot design (e.g. type of DB used)

### technical/integrated-pilot-integration-steps.md
- better steps for launching test harness
- separate into test harness doc and functionality doc (deep linking etc)?

### technical/standalone-pilot-integration-steps.md
 - quickrate badge
  - "There are two types of panel:" is not correct. Describe how badge behaves depending on pilot being published or not
  - quickrate badge for BBC pages code snippet



Details to add/change
=====================

- scaling advice (separate DB, etc)
- adding echo (technical doc)
- previewing pilot in live test (?preview=true)
- quick rate badge behaviour for unpublished pilots
- SMP documentation/integration
- guidance for Wordpress?
- advice on Facebook/Twitter login?
- secured admin/duration tools
- add download link to Katie's spreadsheet
  - This spreadsheet will provide guidance to all the activities needed for Integrating with Taster.
  Additionally, it will help pilots to manage a check list of activities



New sections to consider
========================

### what happens after a pilot has ended
 - will we switch it off?
 - what do we do with pilots that have requests for continued hosting
 - reflecting on rating info



Oli feedback
============

The different on-boarding pages could benefit from a quick summary/section overview at the top of the page. 

We need a bit more 'why' in there
 - guiding principles around what benefit piloting projects brings and in consequence what do we need to think about when we are developing. 
 - I'd say - simplicity, measurement, thoughts for what happens next / scale are some good things to bear in mind. 

Audience - are you looking at this as the single point of record for all pilot onboarding (Inc 'business people')? Or is it just for tech integration? - I think there is some more clarity we could give around the tasks producers / sponsors have in this process.   

Standalone pilots
 - we don't mention what the badge actually does re rating and survey answers and how this is driven by the work you do with content producers.
 - should we have a section explaining rating/questionnaire and explain how this is surfaced in integrated/standalone pilots?
