Integration Hooks for New Window (Off-Site) pilots
==================================================

Although in theory any pilots can open in a new window (for example, to work around bugs
which only occur when in an IFrame), we encourage most pilots to go into an IFrame rather
than popping out a new window. However, if the pilot is a complete website or similar, then
a new window pilot is appropriate.

New window pilots have the downside of not being surrounded by the Taster frame, so rating and sharing
functionality is not automatically exposed.

## Static Badging

Some static images are available which you can drop into your application, with a link back to
Taster's rate screen. This should only be used when a HTML solution is not possible.

## Responsive Badging

Our preferred solution is an embeddable widget which exposes the Taster rate button.
