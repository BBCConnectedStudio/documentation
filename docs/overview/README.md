# Pilots for Taster

## Welcome

Pilot applications aim to test and validate new ideas through real audience feedback. [BBC Taster](http://www.bbc.co.uk/taster) is a platform that allows the presentation of these pilots to an audience and provides a framework for gathering user feedback.

Pilots applications are typically (but not always) web applications. This documentation gives an overview of the steps you (the pilot author) and the BBC Taster team will go through together, concentrating on the development and deployment activities, to build, deploy and present the pilot in Taster.

## Overview

You've had your idea, you know what pilot application you want to build to test that idea with a real audience. Now what?

- [**Describe the pilot**](pilot-description.md): Tell us about your pilot application
- [**Present the pilot in Taster**](presentation.md): Choose the user journey for presenting the pilot in Taster
- [**Hosting your pilot**](hosting.md): Understand and choose how the pilot application is hosted
- **Learn from the audience**: Measure and interpret how the audience uses your application
- **Maximise reach**: Who can use your pilot, and what browsers/devices are supported
- [**Security**](information-security.md): Ensure your audience is safe when using the pilot
- [**Deploy your application**](deployment.md): Transfer your pilot into its (live) hosting environment
- [**Publish the pilot**](publishing.md): Launch the pilot in Taster and let the public use it!
