#Deploying your application

When your application is working, you will want to deploy it into the live environment. We **strongly recommend deploying your application early** (even if its not *finished* yet) so that deployment and integration issues can be discovered and resolved.

It is perfectly normal to expect multiple deployments to occur before the pilot is ready to be [published](publishing) for use by the public.


The deployment of your application is dependent on how it is [hosted](hosting)

If the pilot is [third party hosted](hosting#third-party-hosted) then you're on your own.

TODO (maybe we can do DNS record)?

If your pilot is [Taster hosted](hosting#taster-hosted) then read on...
