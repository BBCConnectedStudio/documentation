# Hosting and Presenting

Pilots are typically web applications (i.e. loaded in a web browser) - integrating them into Taster requires two key questions to be answered:
- How is the pilot presented in Taster
- How is the pilot application hosted?

Every pilot has a dedicated "pilot info" page within the site, that gives an overview of the experience and allows the user to "try it".

## Integrated pilot

An integrated pilot is presented within the pilot info page, by loading the pilot in an `<iframe>`

## Standalone pilot

A standalone pilot is presented within the pilot info page, by loading the pilot in an `<iframe>`
