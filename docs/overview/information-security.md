#Information Security

For Taster to present a pilot a security review of the application must occur.

We work in partnership with the BBC's Information Security team (InfoSec) to perform these reviews, and look to assess the following key criteria
- what user data is collected, and how is it used?
- has the application considered security, and does it have any potential weaknesses or flaws?
- is the environment used to host the application secure?


Note the [application and hosting diagrams](pilot-description.md) help us to easily verify that your application is secure and any user data collected/used by the pilot adheres to BBC policy.
