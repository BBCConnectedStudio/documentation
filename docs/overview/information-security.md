#Information Security

For Taster to present a pilot a security review of the application must occur.

We work in partnership with the BBC's Information Security team (InfoSec) to perform these reviews, and look to assess two key criteria
- what user data is collected, and how is it used?
- has the application considered security, and does it have any potential weaknesses or flaws?

(copy for link to/from tech diagram)?
It is still **important**, however, to describe your application to us so that we can verify that any user data collected/used by the pilot adheres to BBC policy.
