#Connected Studio Pilot Kickoff Pack

The information below is meant to support the kickoff process for a Connected Studio pilot project. There are many things to think about when starting a pilot, and we hope this info will act as a good reference and make things a bit simpler for you.

##The PID

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is sometimes referred to as a PAR (Project Authorisation Request) but both are essentially describing the same thing: a document outlining the brief for the project, which is to be provided by the Project Manager to the indie at the start of the project.

For reference, a template for this document can be found here.

##Statement of Work

Once the PID has been received by the indie, they can draw up a detailed Statement of Work (SoW) which outlines the work to be done, together with costs. The contract will be based on this once it has been agreed.

A set of guidelines for what a SoW should include can be found here.

##Technical Considerations

A technical representative from Connected Studio/Taster will be assigned to the project from the beginning, and should be able to help answer any questions about the technical approach that should be taken.

Around kickoff, the teams will also have to agree on the platfroms that will be supported by the pilot (devices, browsers etc). Your Taster technical lead can help guide this decision, but it is normally a compromise between technical feasibility, cost, and audience reach.

##Taster Integration

For most CS pilots, the intention will be to get them onto BBC Taster for a trial period of 3 months. There will be a number of activities involved in integrating the pilot with the Taster site and making sure it works correctly. This includes things like deciding on whether the pilot will open in an iFrame within the Taster page, or as a new window. It also includes information about cookie wanrnings, analytics, the Taster 'badge' used to collect ratings, and the Taster test harness.
Information about all of these can be found [here](pilot-technical-pack.md). It’s recommended that indies have a look at this early on so they can plan for these activities.

##Digital Analytics or ‘iStats’

Some pilots will include digital analytics in order to track certain interactions within the content, and thus gather information about particular user behaviour. This is considered to be supplementary Audience Testing information (please see the section on Audience Testing below to see how this fits in with the other measurements we are able to make).

The ‘tagging spec’ containing a list of what will be tagged, and the correct tag names, will be provided by the Connected Studio and Taster team. The tags themselves will need to be implemented by the indie (technical information on the BBC’s stats library can be found [here](pilot-technical-pack.md)). Data analysis and reporting on the analytics are the responsibility of the CS and Taster team.

##Testing: the different types

There are three different kinds of testing we talk about at Connected Studio, which can become confusing. These are:

* Audience Testing (AT) - how we test emotional engagement and audience impact

* Usability or ‘user’ Testing - how we test design, ease of use etc

* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - how we test if a correctly functioning product has been delivered

Click [here](pilot-testing.md) to read more on each of these kinds of testing, including when they are carried out and who has responsibility for them.

##User Experience and Design

The design and user experience of the pilot is the responsibility of the pilot team, however we are able to offer some support (for example in the form of design guidance from our Creative Director) where necessary.
### Fonts
Any fonts reqired should preferably be available in the [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) collection, which the BBC already has a licence to use.

##Editorial Policy and Moderation

All pilots will need some consideration of Editorial Policy issues, and in some cases (for example where user generated content is involved) moderation may be required. It is the responsibility of the BBC Editorial team to decide if this is required - but any potentially sensitive content should be flagged by the pilot team as early as possible, particularly because, if moderation is required, extra technical effort will be required from the pilot team to integrate with the BBC moderation system.

##Content Rights

Any pilot appearing on Taster will require a ‘WebasC’ form to be completed, listing all the assets used and any rights details. It will be the BBC Editorial team’s responsibility to do this nearer the end of the pilot, but the pilot team should be aware that they may need to keep a log of any images, video clips, audio clips, music etc that they use, which will make the process much simpler.

##Trademarking and Copyright

It is recommended that the title and any key descriptions of the project are decided on early so they may be checked for trademark and copyright infringement. This will be done by the BBC Project Manager, but teams should be aware of this so it can be done before any graphics or other assets are created, so as to avoid costly changes later on.
