#Deploying your application

When your application is working, you will want to deploy it into the live environment. We **strongly recommend deploying your application early** (even if its not *finished* yet) so that deployment and integration issues can be discovered and resolved.

It is perfectly normal to expect multiple deployments to occur before the pilot is ready to be [published](publishing) for use by the public.


The deployment of your application is dependent on how it is [hosted](hosting)

If the pilot is [third party hosted](hosting.md#third-party-hosted) then are responsible for its deployment.

If your pilot is [Taster hosted](hosting.md#taster-hosted) then a deployment plan must be agreed with the Taster team - our
technical staff will work with you to deploy your application into our hosting environment
