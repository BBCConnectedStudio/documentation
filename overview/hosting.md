# Hosting the pilot

The code and assets that power your pilot application need to be hosted on a webserver. There are two choices for how your pilot application is hosted.

*Note that how the pilot is hosted is independent of how it is [presented](presentation.md) in Taster* 

## Taster hosted

We can host your application by deploying it into our (BBC sponsored) AWS account, offering the following benefits

**Pros**
- We perform application deployment
- We can offer (limited) first line operational support of your application
- We support the hosting environment
- Our AWS account is signed off for use as a hosting environment by InfoSec


**Cons**
- Support is office hours only
- We can only offer limited support of your actual application, e.g. looking at log files
- We cannot provide access to the running infrastructure to your (development) team

##Â Third party hosted

It is possible to self-host your pilot application in your chosen hosting environment. In addition to signing off the **actual pilot application**  (see [information security](./information-security.md)) we will also need to assess the chosen hosting environment.

**Pros**
- You have control of your applications deployment and infrastructure

**Cons**
- You are responsible for deployment and support of the application
- The hosting environment will **require approval from the BBC Information Security team** by completing a *Holding And Hosting* form

**Note**
Third party hosting includes many (commercial) options that may already have been used by previous Taster pilots, e.g. YouTube, Tumblr or Interlude. For hosting solutions that have been used before it is safe to assume the necessary H&H requirements have been satisfied.
