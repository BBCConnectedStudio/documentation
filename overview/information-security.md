#Information Security

For Taster to present a pilot a security review of the application must occur.

We work in partnership with the BBC's Information Security team (InfoSec) to perform these reviews, and look to assess the following key criteria
- what user data is collected, and how is it used?
- has the application considered security, and does it have any potential weaknesses or flaws?
- is the environment used to host the application secure?

## The review process

Whilst some applications can be approved as secure by the Taster team, many pilots will require a full evaluation by completing two forms:
 - **Compliance Summary** - a description of how the application works and the steps taken to secure it
 - **Software Weakness Review** - a checklist of the [top 25 software weaknesses](http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/), and how your application considers them
 
Note the [application and hosting diagrams](pilot-description.md) are critical here as they allow us to:
- make a call on InfoSecs behalf on whether a formal review is required
- be included in the **Compliane Summary** (for pilots needing a formal review) to help InfoSec verify that your application is secure and any user data collected/used by the pilot adheres to BBC policy.
 
If your pilot requires these forms to be completed then you will be given access to the BBC's systems to complete them and discuss them with the InfoSec team.
