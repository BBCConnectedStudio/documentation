# Presenting the pilot in Taster

Every pilot has a dedicated "pilot info" page within the Taster site that gives an overview of the experience and allows the user to "Try it".

When the user clicks the "Try it" button, the pilot is presented to them in one of two ways. You should choose the presentation style appropriate to your pilot

## Integrated pilot

An integrated pilot is presented within the pilot info page, by loading the pilot in an `<iframe>`

More information for preparing an integrated pilot is given [here](../technical/integrated-pilot-integration-steps.md)  

## Standalone pilot

A standalone pilot is presented in its own page - the "Try it" button opens the in a new tab in the user's browser.

## Accessibility

However you choose to present your pilot, you must ensure it adheres to [BBC accessibility standards](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/) where possible.
