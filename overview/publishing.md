# Publishing your pilot in Taster

To make the pilot live in Taster so that the audience can use there are a few final checks that must be approved

## Technical review

All pilots must be reviewed by one of the BBC's technical team prior to appearing in Taster. The important
factors to consider are related to scalability and security.

## Analytics check

The Taster technical team will check your pilot and confirm we are seeing standard analytics calls being made correctly.
We can also check that *at least one* custom analytics call is being made (if you are using them) but cannot check that
*every* custom analytics call is being made - we would expect this to be done by the pilot team as part of their functional testing
