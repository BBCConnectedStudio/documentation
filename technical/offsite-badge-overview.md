# Taster Offsite Badge

These instructions are for pilot teams for whom their pilot will not be integrated into Taster. In this instance, Taster will present a link which will direct users to a different URL under which the pilot is accessible. As such, the rating/sharing functionality which is built into Taster will not be accessible. The solution to this problem has been resolved through the use of iFrames.

We have developed two badges which will sit within your pilot. There is a Slim edition and a Classic Edition.

## Slim edition

The Taster Slim Badge is a small badge that sits at a fixed position at the upper right hand side of your pilot. A demonstration version is visible at:

http://dummy.pilots.bbcconnectedstudio.co.uk/offsite_slim

If you wish to use this version of the badge, please refer to the integration documentation in the associated document, i.e:

[**Slim Badge Integration Guide**](offsite-slim-badge-integration.md)

## Classic edition (Under Development)

The Taster Classic Badge is a larger badge that sits full width at the very top of your pilot, above all other content as a separate element. This means that it will not hover over content within your pilot, but also uses more screen real estate. This may, or may not use the `rate` endpoint.
If you wish to use the classic badge at this time, please refer to the integration documentation in the associated document, i.e:

[Classic Badge Integration Guide](standalone-pilot-integration-steps.md)
